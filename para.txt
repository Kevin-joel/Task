A Bus Reservation Web App is an online platform that allows passengers to easily search, book, and manage bus tickets from the comfort of their homes. It provides a user-friendly interface where customers can view available buses, check seat availability, compare ticket prices, and select their preferred travel dates and destinations. The system also ensures convenience by offering secure online payments, e-tickets, and instant booking confirmations. For administrators, it simplifies operations by managing bus schedules, seat allocations, and passenger records in real time. Overall, a bus reservation web app reduces manual effort, saves time, improves accuracy, and enhances the overall travel booking experience for both passengers and service providers.
